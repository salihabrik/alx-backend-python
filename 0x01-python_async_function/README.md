## Python - Async

# Concurrent Coroutines in Python

This project involves writing asynchronous coroutines in Python using the `asyncio` library. The main task is to create a coroutine `wait_n` that spawns another coroutine `wait_random` multiple times and returns the results in ascending order.

## Files

- `0-basic_async_syntax.py`: Contains the `wait_random` coroutine that waits for a random delay and then returns it.
- `1-concurrent_coroutines.py`: Contains the `wait_n` coroutine that spawns `wait_random` multiple times and returns the results in ascending order.

## Usage

Run the Python scripts from the command line as follows:
